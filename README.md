### Abstract
This project illustrates multiple interactive data visualization dashboards using Tableau. The dataset that was used for this visualization is from David Rieman's "K-12 School Shooting Database" from 2022. This visualization aims to provide insights about school shootings in the United States and therefore leading to policy changes. The Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms has been a controversial topic in the US in the recent years, due to the amount of gun violence that happens nationwide yearly. The visualization compares the number of school-related shooting incidents that have taken place from 1970 to 2022, showing a significant increase within the last few years. These findings show that specific trends school shootings in the US, which can then be used to spur legislative changes, as the need for a safer educational setting becomes more important than ever.
